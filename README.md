# owt Premium Edition

* [Premium](https://github.com/clu3bot/owt/wiki/owt-Premium)

# Dependencies 
* aircrack-ng 
* mdk3
* xterm
* macchanger
* ***owt tool will prompt the user to download these dependencies if they arent installed.***

# In The Works
* Expanding owt from being just for wireless network attacking. More information below.
* Adding more advanced functionality to owt such as NTP amplification attacks to screw with NTP servers for dosing websites. 
* Adding AP tracking functionality and ability to save lists of common saved networks that devices have in the area. I.E if there is a starbucks near by you can track if starbucks is a common AP that phones in the area have as a saved network. This is useful for knowing which APs to spoof. 
* Adding a method of saving text or csv files of device names and mac-addresses on a newtwork. 
* Making a windows version of owt. 
* Major U.I changes 
* Fixing the "issue" where owt doesn't support use within Virtual Machines. Not priority as this is a pain in the ass but has been requested :)
